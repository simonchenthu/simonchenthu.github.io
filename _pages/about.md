I am a C.L.E. Moore Instructor at the [Department of Mathematics at MIT](https://math.mit.edu/index.php), mentored by Prof. [Philippe Rigollet](https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/). 
I received my Ph.D. in the [Department of Mathematics at UW-Madison](https://math.wisc.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qin Li](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~qinli/). 
Prior to this, I obtained bachelor's degrees from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Here is my [CV](files/shichen-cv.pdf).

I work in applied mathematics. I am particularly interested in problems arising in **Machine Learning**, **Gradient Flows and Optimization**, **Inverse Problems** and their applications in physics and data science.
