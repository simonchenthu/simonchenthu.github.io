I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qin Li](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~qinli/). Prior to this, I obtained bachelor's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Here is my [CV](files/shichen-cv.pdf).

I am particularly interested in **Inverse Problems**, **Machine Learning**, **Scientific Computing**, **Multiscale Modeling and Computation**.

I am searching for internship opportunities in the summer of 2022.
